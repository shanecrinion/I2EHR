### **EHR Research**


#### *Irish EHR*


The information I've found has been predominantly from EHealth Ireland:

#####1. *What is an EHR?*

(http://www.ehealthireland.ie/Strategic-Programmes/Electronic-Health-Record-EHR-/What-is-an-EHR-.html)

- Patient records and key information currently locked in paper format
- EHR implementation will result in:
    - Better, safer clinical decision making,
    - More informed and engaged patients and citizens,
    - Integration of services across care settings,
    - Increased availability of information to enable proactive management of patients and conditions,
    - Improved patient outcomes.


#####2. *Electronic Health Records*

(http://www.ehealthireland.ie/Strategic-Programmes/Electronic-Health-Record-EHR-/)

- identified by HSE National Directors and clinical leaders as a key capability requirement for the future delivery of healthcare
- primary focus on how clinicians and administrative staff work with this technology
- requires significant transformation in the use of technology and data to underpin effective and efficient care
- provide benefits to patients, service users, carers, health and social care professionals and wider stakeholders in the health system.
- safer, better and increasingly, personalised care.


#####3. *EHR as cornerstone of eHealth Strategy*

(http://www.ehealthireland.ie/Strategic-Programmes/Electronic-Health-Record-EHR-/)

- The national core operational solutions (with functions such as ePrescribing and Case Management
- ability to aggregate data from these systems into a comprehensive national record
- accessible to health and social care professionals, and also to patients, service users and carers.
- Knowledge and Information Strategy of the Office of the CIO (Chief Information Office):  the national EHR has been identified as a **core** capability.


#####4. *Progress and Current Update*

(http://www.ehealthireland.ie/Strategic-Programmes/Electronic-Health-Record-EHR-/Progress/)

- Quote from the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare Sláintecare Report:
  - "Continued strong support of the e-health strategy - particularly ensuring the necessary funding for timely roll-out of the EHR system" is recommended


#####5. *Case Study: St Vincent's Hospital*

(http://www.ehealthireland.ie/Library/Document-Library/Case-Studies/St-Vincent%E2%80%99s-data-driven-emergency-department-transforms-patient-pathways.pdf)

- Emergency Department (ED) implementation of EHR in conjunction with IMS Maxims
- functionally rich, easy-to-use ED system that fully integrates with other hospital systems 
- provides a comprehensive suite of reporting analytical tools.
- allows real-time tracking of a patient journey and provides an instant overview of a patient’s status
- measures key performance targets set by the Health Service Executive (HSE). 
- The challenges that lead to its implementation:
    - hospital had since outgrown its functionality 
    - too much time spent on unnecessary administrative tasks   
    - increased contact time with patients needed. 
    - Communication issues between departments
- EHR implementation has lead to...
    - **Clinically led change:**
        - Faster access to patient records
        - “Access to demographic data on our patients allows us to deliver timely critical care to injured and ill patients that attend our department with emergencies.”
    - **Greater usability** 
        - lower the number of times staff had to log-in to disparate systems.
        - Reduce clicks and increase software integration
        - integration of hospital reports, training videos and links to third party systems
    - **Improved resource planning and reporting**
        - St Vincent’s has greater visibility of trends in admissions
        - "The tracking system is highly valuable for ourselves and visiting physicians in locating patients in an environment where there can at times be in excess of 100 patients being cared for"


#### *Reviews*

#####1. *Electronic Health Records: Then, Now, and in the Future*

#####2. *Machine learning and electronic health records: A paradigm shift*

#####3. *Processing of Electronic Health Records using Deep Learning: a review*

#### *Studies*

#####1. *Scalable and accurate deep learning with electronic health records**

#####2. *(Journal Club) Detecting potential pleiotropy across cardiovascular and neurological diseases using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate methods on 43,870 individuals from the eMERGE network*

```



### **R Shiny**

#### *App Development*

#### *Studies*

#####1. *Characterizing Allegheny County Opioid Overdoses with an Interactive Data Explorer and Synthetic Prediction Tool*


Files to outline:


#### *To Do / Want to Do*

- Create a timeline 
- Use the format of the FHIR paper

### **Observations/Proposals/Questions/Suggestions**

- I want to use FHIR file format because this is used in medical records, currently using CSV for my dataframe
- Machine Learning is a large component of using EHR for genomic research and I think I'm lacking in machine learning knowledge. Online courses seem to be long so looking for a short one to understand it  better
- Using the RShiny app from the HI7 FHIR paper 
    - Use patient and cohort approach
    - Do this on Type II diabetes patients
- Do you know of any other approaches using EHR
- Many papers available regarding using patient data to make predictions or diagnose. Should I also be studying papers have little/no genomic data but show succesful use of EHR 

### **Observations**

- EHR papers involving genomics are hard to come by

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r shiny 1}

```
